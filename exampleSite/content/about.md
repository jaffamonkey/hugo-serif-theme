I have been working in area of testing and quality for over 25 years. Do I enjoy it? Well, my head does like puzzles to work out! The challenges of testing provide technical and human puzzles. I am very technically-focused, but also adept with teams.  Communication is key in testing, and that is something I have carried from contract to contract.

I started out in the tail of of the 1990's, when Waterfall was still common and testing was judged by the weight of arch-lever files (only half-joking).  When I jumped on Agile train in 2002, I found more inspiration in testing - not least from opensource world. As technical demands on testers grew in the 00's, I grew with them. 

I learnt early on to take a lean approach to testing - including strategy, reporting and test frameworks. I immersed myself further into devops, working in parallel with development by following their tools process and pace. Until a test is in CI/CD pipelines, testing does not have a firm foothold.

 From toxic corporations to fresh startups, I have learnt that testing can be improved and have positive effect on the rest of the project, whatever the challenges.
