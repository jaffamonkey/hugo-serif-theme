summary: "Bringing quality to all aspects of a project, bringing quality assurance and testing to the SDLC, from design to production."

If you are trying to `shift left`, I can help bring testing earlier and more frequently, into the design and development cycles.

Startups make up the bulk of clients, and I enjoy working with that kind of vibe. But I can cater for in corporatons and SME's too. I am adept at delivering quality to the tightest of timescales.

## How does it work?

We can work out timescales and tasks, depending on your needs and budget. Whether you want a little help getting more automation in your pipeline, or need some eneral app performance checks, I can deliver results. 

This won't be done in isolation - it's not the 1990's, so it's just just a matter to deliverables, it's about engagement with you and your team to ensure you have input you need.

## Deliverables
- Adaptive test strategies.
- Applying quality checks from design through to development.
- UI test frameworks
- API test frameworks with service virtulisation to ensure test continuity.
- Performance tests with every build to check Accessibility, Load and Security.
- Integration of tests into CI/CD pipelines.
